# Description
-The Bad Batch is currently on the planet Tatooine. 
-To hide their tracks, they decided that they would only get fuel for their ship from their trusted allies on each planet they land on, enroute to Naboo. 
-In order to go from one planet to the next, they need to do one hyperspace teleport. The one hyperspace teleport requires one litre of fuel. 
-Upon landing on a planet, unfortunately, there is a malfunction in the engines of the ship that drains out all the fuel it has and they depend on the fuel that they can get from their trusted allies on that planet. 
-However, if they want to teleport from one planet to the other by skipping a planet in the middle of the route, they must keep in mind if the amount of fuel that they currently hold would be enough for the number of hyperspace teleports that would get them to that further planet. ie. they need to do the hyperspace teleports in the order of the planets but they donâ€™t have to land and take the fuel from the trusted allies in the middle.
-May the Force be with them!
